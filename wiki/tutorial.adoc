= Concepts

The `tst` is a C++ library which provides facilities for unit and other testing. It follows basic link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit[xUnit] concepts.

== Test case
Test case is a function which performs the testing of a program.

== Test suite
Test cases are organized into test suites, just to have some structuring.
Then it is possible to easily run only test cases belonging to a certain test suite, or disable all test cases from a certain test suite.

== Test set
In `tst`, the test set is a group of test cases defined right next to each other. So, the test set means only where the test case is defined and nothing more. This is just a convenience entity and does not affect test cases structuring, unlike test suite.

= Basic usage

Please note, that `tst` uses C++'17 features, so it needs a compiler which supports that {cpp} standard.

== Code under test

For different testing frameworks it is quite —Åommon to use a `factorial(x)` function as a sample code under test. So, we will use it as well in this tutorial.

[source,c++]
....
int factorial(int n){
	int ret = 1;
	for(int i = 2; i <= n; ++i){
		ret *= i;
	}
	return ret;
}
....

== Test runner application

For running test cases we need to create a test runner application.

For simple use case `tst` does not require defining any program entry point. The library does it for you.

So, for defining our first test case, our test runner application will consist of just one source file `test_factorial.cpp`, this is where we will write our test cases.

== Include tst headers

First of all we need to include some headers.

[source,c++]
....
#include <tst/set.hpp> // test sets are used to declare groups of tests
#include <tst/check.hpp> // family of check() functions (think assert)
....

== Create a test set

We need to create a test set object which will allow us to declare test cases.

[source,c++]
....
namespace{
tst::set factorial_test_set("factorial", [](tst::suite& suite){
	// this is where we will declare our test cases
});
}
....

The constructor of the `tst::set` class has two arguments:

. The name of the test suite to which all test cases defined in this test set will be added.
. The test case declaration functor. This functor will be called by `tst` to instantiate the test cases. The argument of the functor is a test suite object to which the test cases are to be added.

Note, that the name of the `tst::set` object does not matter, it can be anything you like, but should not clash with other names, of course. In our case we used `factorial_test_set`.

Also, we defined the test set object inside of the anonymous namespace to prevent the symbol to be exported. This is not mandatory and is not critical to do it that way, but just for the sake of code cleanness.

== Declare first test case

As a first test case, let's check that our function correctly calculates factorial of some numbers.

[source,c++]
....
namespace{
tst::set factorial_test_set("factorial", [](tst::suite& suite){
	suite.add(
			"positive_arguments_must_produce_expected_result",
			[](){
				tst::check(factorial(1) == 1, SL);
				tst::check(factorial(2) == 2, SL);
				tst::check(factorial(3) == 6, SL);
				tst::check(factorial(8) == 40320, SL);
			}
		);
});
}
....

Here we use the `tst::suite::add()` method to add the test case to the suite. 

. The first argument is the test name. Note that, not all characters are allowed to be in the test case name, e.g. space characters are not allowed. Basically, only letters, numbers and underscores are allowed.
. The second argument is a test case itself, or it's procedure.

Note, that in the body of the test case function we used `tst::check()` function. This is basically an assertion function of `tst`. The second argument must always be `SL`. It is needed to make it possible for the function to know at which position in the source code it was acutally called. The `SL` is a macro which substitutes an object instance which holds the source file name and line number. **In case your compiler supports C++'20 standard, then adding the trailing `SL` argument is not necessary, all `check()` functions can be called without it.**

== Declare a test case parametrized by value

Sometimes it is handy to define a single test case function for a set of different test values. We can do that using an overload of `tst::suite::add()` method which allows passing in an array of parameter values.

[source,c++]
....
namespace{
tst::set factorial_test_set("factorial", [](tst::suite& suite){
	suite.add<std::pair<int, int>>(
			"positive_arguments_must_produce_expected_result",
			{
				{1, 1}, // input and expected value pairs
				{2, 2},
				{3, 6},
				{8, 40320}
			},
			[](const auto& i){
				tst::check(factorial(i.first) == i.second, SL);
			}
		);
});
}
....

== All our test cases in the same set

To sum up, our test set would look like this:

[source,c++]
....
namespace{
tst::set factorial_test_set("factorial", [](tst::suite& suite){
	// define simple test case
	suite.add(
			"positive_arguments_must_produce_expected_result",
			[](){
				tst::check(factorial(1) == 1, SL);
				tst::check(factorial(2) == 2, SL);
				tst::check(factorial(3) == 6, SL);
				tst::check(factorial(8) == 40320, SL);
			}
		);
	
	// define parametrized test case
	// Note, the name is the same as for simple test case above.
	// In parametrized case, a '[n]' suffix will be automatically
	// appended to each test case for corresponding value index.
	// So, in this case it is OK, and there will be no name clashing.
	suite.add<std::pair<int, int>>(
			"positive_arguments_must_produce_expected_result",
			{
				{1, 1}, // input and expected value pairs
				{2, 2},
				{3, 6},
				{8, 40320}
			},
			[](const auto& i){
				tst::check(factorial(i.first) == i.second, SL);
			}
		);
});
}
....

== Disabling test cases

Sometimes it is needed to temporarily disable the test case, for various reasons. In order to keep track of disabled test cases, instead of commenting them, one should use `tst::suite::add_disabled()` methods, instead of `tst::suite::add()`. So, just simply change the name of the `add()` method to disable the test case.

== Adding custom info to check failure message

When a check performed with `tst::check()` function fails, the test case is interrupted and a failure message is printed as the output. By default the message contains source file name and line number on which the check has failed.

Often, it is desired to add custom information to such failure message. For that `tst` provides two different approaches.

=== Adding failure message via callback function

[source,c++]
....
int a = 3;

tst::check(a == 4, [&](auto& o){o << "a = " << a;}, SL);
....

So, as an additional argument of the `check()` function is a callback which is called only in case of check failure to obtain the additional failure message information.

=== Adding failure message via check_result object

[source,c++]
....
int a = 3;

tst::check(a == 4, SL) << "a = " << a;
....

So, the `check()` function returns a stream-like object through which we add custom message. The drawback of this method is that in case the check succeeds, all the values output to the stream are still evaluated. So, one needs to be careful with this approach to avoid undesired function calls as part of stream output evaluation in case there is no failure.

== Various check functions

Along with common `tst::check()` function the `tst` provides a number of secific check-functions for certain comparison type. For example `tst::check_eq()` for comparing for equality. These specific functions automatically add information about their arguments into the check failure message.

== Conclusion

This tutorial covers only some basic use cases. But `tst` can provide more flexibility if needed with the usage of `tst::application` class.
